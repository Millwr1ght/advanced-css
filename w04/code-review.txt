Bootstrap is really cool. The way it's set up is really similar to Atomic CSS: all you need to do to change how th HTML is styled is to change the classes for the elements. I really like that fiddling with classes in the HTML code is most of what working with Bootstrap seems to be because I so far have not been very good at keeping track of my CSS. This should keep the CSS file size relatively small which will be super nice. I've noticed that it's also kind of set up like BEM, where Bootstrap classes are organized by what sort of block and element they affect.

The Bootstrap file is pretty well organized as well. It's super quick and easy to find the 'documentation' for a Bootstrap style because its files and folders are very well divided. Each partial is named for what it affects and that file affects nothing else :'_{target element}.scss'. For example: '_accordion.scss' has all the Bootstrap for accordions and '_spinner.scss' has all the Bootstrap for spinners. The _variables partial was overwhelming at first glance and first scroll through; it's super duper long and incredibly comprehensive. If I was working with that with what skills I have now as a developer I would be incredibly worried that by changing anything in that I would irrevocably screw everything else up. It is probably simpler and lass disastrous than I'm thinking but again, with how comfortable I am right now with scss and css, I feel I would somehow seriously ruin it.
